DequeExample
============

<b>Interview Question: </b><br/>

<i>"Please could you create a Java class that contains a method that takes a single parameter (a long), and returns the largest value that the method has been called with within ten minutes of the current invocation.

Please think carefully about your choice of data structures, to ensure that your class will perform acceptably across a range of different input types and calling frequencies."</i>

<b>Solution:</b>
Simple example of using a Deque Queue to run an in memory store of the largest number (long) within a given time period. This defaults to 10 minutes but can be overridden on instantiation.
